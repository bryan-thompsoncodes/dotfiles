# setup-omarchy.sh — conservative, additive dotfiles setup for Omarchy hosts.
#
# Omarchy owns its own environment (shell, terminal, editor, Git, tmux, GPG,
# Zed, and tool settings). This entry point deploys only additive personal
# assets — currently the curated agent-skill links — and never runs Stow,
# installs packages, or uses elevated privileges.
#
# Future additive reconcilers get appended to the RECONCILERS list below;
# application-specific mutation logic never lives in this script itself.

Usage: setup-omarchy.sh (--check | --apply) [--force]

  --check   Report what --apply would change. Never mutates the filesystem.
  --apply   Perform the additive setup (per-tool agent-skill links only).
  --force   Proceed even if this host does not identify as Omarchy.

Never run 'stow .' or 'stow --adopt' against your home on an Omarchy host;
this script is the supported installation path there.

Ownership summary:
  This setup is additive. It links curated personal agent skills into
  ~/.claude/skills, ~/.config/opencode/skills, ~/.pi/agent/skills, and
  ~/.hermes/skills/personal, and appends one marked source line to an
  existing ~/.bashrc (Omarchy's designated personal-additions section)
  loading portable aliases from dot-config/shell/aliases.sh — nothing else.

  Intentionally left untouched (Omarchy owns these):
    - login shell selection and Omarchy's bash defaults
    - terminal configuration (foot/alacritty)
    - ~/.config/nvim
    - Git configuration (~/.config/git, ~/.gitconfig)
    - tmux configuration
    - ~/.gnupg
    - Zed, OpenCode, and Claude settings files
    - anything under /usr/share/omarchy

  No Stow operation, package installation, or privileged command was run.
