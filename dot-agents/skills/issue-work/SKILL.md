name: issue-work
description: End-to-end GitHub/Forgejo ticket workflow. Use when the user shares a ticket URL (github.com/owner/repo/issues/N or /pull/N), a shorthand like owner/repo#123, asks to "start on ticket", "pick up this issue", "work on this ticket", or pastes issue text asking for implementation. Fetches ticket with all comments and linked work, creates a worktree, spawns parallel exploration agents, proposes an implementation plan for approval, implements, runs tests, then runs parallel self-review (correctness/security/simplicity) before returning for human review.

# Issue Work

End-to-end workflow for taking a GitHub or Forgejo ticket from URL to review-ready implementation. Four phases: **Intake → Plan → Implement → Self-Review**. Intake includes a mandatory plan-source gate before any worktree or implementation work begins.

Execution state lives under `{TRUNK_ROOT}/.hermes/issue-work/`. When the project has a vault, an approved `issue-plan` note is the preferred durable planning authority; the state-root `plan.md` is a derived execution snapshot. The workflow still works without a vault when the issue itself passes the plan-readiness rubric.

**Ticket ownership rule:** when the request names one or more tracked issues and also names a narrower implementation workflow, keep `issue-work` as the umbrella unless the user explicitly limits the task to an implementation/review-only handoff. Load the narrower workflow in Phase 3 rather than replacing ticket intake, durable state, self-review, and the ship gate. A publication prohibition remains in force until Phase 4 obtains item-level approval; it is not a reason to skip the umbrella.

---

## Inputs Accepted

- GitHub issue URL: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{N}`
- GitHub PR URL: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/pull/{N}`
- Forgejo URL: `https://{host}/{owner}/{repo}/(issues|pulls)/{N}`
- Shorthand: `{owner}/{repo}#{N}` (GitHub)
- Raw pasted ticket text (asks for repo)

## State Root

All per-ticket state lives at:

```
{TRUNK_ROOT}/.hermes/issue-work/{owner}-{repo}-{N}/
```

This survives worktree teardown. Resume is supported by reading `progress.md` frontmatter `status:` field.

---

## Phase 0 — Pre-flight

### 0.1 Runtime capability mapping

Use the host's native operations; do not require one agent framework or plugin:

| Operation | Hermes | Other compatible hosts |
|---|---|---|
| Clarify a decision | interactive clarification (`clarify`) | conversational prompt / `AskUserQuestion` |
| Track implementation tasks | task list (`todo`) | native todo/task-list tool |
| Delegate isolated research/review | `delegate_task` | `Task`, `Agent`, or equivalent |
| Create/enter worktree | `wt switch --create` then run tools with that worktree as `workdir` | `EnterWorktree` or controlled `git worktree` fallback |
| Resolve an approved project-vault plan | load Hermes `vault-pkm`; follow `issue-plan`'s handoff contract | host-native `vault-pkm` plus the same contract |
| Write the approved plan | load Hermes `plan` | `superpowers:writing-plans` or equivalent |
| Execute an approved plan | on a Codex-backed Hermes parent, route SGG to `codex-claude-implementation-loop`, route other repos to `codex-qwen-implementation-loop`, or use host-native GPT when explicitly requested | host-native implementation workflow |
| Implement test-first | load Hermes `test-driven-development` | host TDD/execution workflow |
| Debug repeated failures | load Hermes `systematic-debugging` | equivalent root-cause workflow |
| Independent final review | load Hermes `requesting-code-review` | equivalent verification/reviewer workflow |
| Push and open the approved draft PR | load Hermes `ship` | host-native `ship` workflow |

If delegation is unavailable, perform the same bounded analysis serially. Missing a framework-specific plugin is never by itself a blocker.

### 0.2 Resume check

After resolving `{TRUNK_ROOT}` in Phase 1.2, compute the state-dir path. If `{TRUNK_ROOT}/.hermes/issue-work/{owner}-{repo}-{N}/progress.md` exists:

1. Read `status:`, `plan_source:`, issue/comment checkpoints, planning-base
   metadata, and, for `plan_source: vault`, source-plan path/status metadata.
2. If the metadata required for that source is missing, classify the state as
   **legacy**. Do not reuse or enter its worktree. Offer to refresh intake
   through Phase 1; never infer a plan source for legacy state.
3. Report: "Found existing work on {ticket}. Status: {status}. Resume or
   refresh?"
4. On **resume**, always re-fetch the issue/comments, recompute the comment
   checkpoint, fetch the current default branch, and rerun the bounded inspection
   plus Phase 1.5 authority validation before skipping phases:
   - For `intake` or `planned`, do not reuse the worktree until the gate passes.
   - For `implementing`, `reviewed`, or `blocked`, compare current authority with
     the recorded approved snapshot. Immaterial drift is logged and resume may
     continue. Material goal/scope/decision/acceptance drift stops for the user;
     do not silently widen implementation or ship stale work.
5. On **refresh**, continue with the full flow and replace prior intake/plan
   state only after the new source passes.

Resume always refreshes authority evidence. It does not regenerate the plan when
evidence is unchanged; material drift routes through the source-specific rules
below.

---

## Phase 1 — Intake

### 1.1 Detect source

Match the input against these patterns **in order** (stop at the first match):

```bash
# 1. GitHub URL — check this FIRST (note the /issues/ path overlaps with Forgejo)
^https?://github\.com/([^/]+)/([^/]+)/(issues|pull)/([0-9]+)

# 2. Shorthand — always GitHub
^([A-Za-z0-9_.-]+)/([A-Za-z0-9_.-]+)#([0-9]+)$

# 3. Forgejo URL — only reached if neither of the above matched
^https?://([^/]+)/([^/]+)/([^/]+)/(issues|pulls)/([0-9]+)
```

**Ordering matters.** GitHub issue URLs also satisfy the Forgejo pattern (both use `/issues/`), so GitHub must be checked first. Only PRs differ by path (`/pull/` vs `/pulls/`).

If none match and the input is ticket-like prose, treat as pasted text and **ask which repo** before proceeding.

### 1.2 Resolve local clone

See [references/repo-resolution.md](references/repo-resolution.md) for details. Short version:

```bash
# Look for a clone matching owner/repo under ~/code/ (1 and 2 levels deep)
Glob(pattern="$HOME/code/*/.git")
Glob(pattern="$HOME/code/*/*/.git")
# For each match, check remote URL matches owner/repo
```

If no local clone: ask before running `gh repo clone {owner}/{repo} ~/code/{repo}`.

Bind the resolved clone path as `{TRUNK_ROOT}` — later phases reference it. If the resolved path is itself a worktree, resolve to the trunk via `git -C {path} rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir` and strip the trailing `/.git` (same pattern used for worktree-aware resolution; see [`agent-workspace/SKILL.md`](../agent-workspace/SKILL.md) → *Worktree-Aware Resolution*).

### 1.3 Create state directory

Create `{TRUNK_ROOT}/.hermes/issue-work/{owner}-{repo}-{N}/` with the host file tools or `mkdir -p`.

### 1.4 Fetch ticket context

Use [references/fetch-ticket.md](references/fetch-ticket.md) to fetch the ticket
body, update timestamp, comments with IDs/update timestamps, linked refs, and
inferred open questions. Compute the canonical comment checkpoint. Prefer an
isolated intake child (`delegate_task` on Hermes; `Task`/`Agent` elsewhere), but
run the same recipe inline when delegation is unavailable. Write `context.md` in
the state directory and read it after completion.

Resolve the forge's current default branch, fetch it against the trunk, and bind
the fetched remote ref and full SHA as `{PLANNING_BASE_REF}` and
`{PLANNING_BASE_SHA}`:

```bash
DEFAULT_BRANCH=$(gh repo view {owner}/{repo} --json defaultBranchRef --jq .defaultBranchRef.name)
# Forgejo: read .default_branch from the repository API.
git -C "{TRUNK_ROOT}" fetch origin "$DEFAULT_BRANCH"
PLANNING_BASE_REF="origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH"
PLANNING_BASE_SHA=$(git -C "{TRUNK_ROOT}" rev-parse "$PLANNING_BASE_REF")
```

If default-branch resolution or fetch fails, stop and surface the authentication
or remote error. Never validate authority against a stale local ref.

Before judging the issue fallback, perform a **bounded read-only inspection** of
that fetched base: active repository instructions, issue-named files/symbols,
neighboring implementation patterns, test locations, and relevant repo-owned
specs/ADRs. Use `git diff`, `git show`, and `git ls-tree` against the fetched ref
when the local checkout differs; never treat stale working-tree content as the
base. A single read-only delegate is allowed when the surface spans distinct
areas, but it must not create a worktree or edit code. Write the concise map to
`intake-inspection.md` in the state directory.

This intake refresh and inspection are prerequisites for deciding whether work
may start. They are not worktree creation or implementation.

### 1.5 Plan-source readiness gate

This gate runs **after** the current ticket/base inspection but **before**
dirty-tree checks, worktree reuse/creation, branch creation, or implementation
delegation. Read [`issue-plan`'s handoff contract](../issue-plan/references/handoff-contract.md), then evaluate these sources in order:

1. **Approved project-vault plan.** Load `vault-pkm`. Resolve only project-vault candidates: a path named by project instructions, `{TRUNK_ROOT}/vault`, then `~/code/notes/{repo}` when it clearly belongs to the repository. Search for the exact canonical issue URL and validate the handoff section, required plan content, linked decisions, issue timestamp, comment checkpoint, current default branch, and fetched-base drift. If one approved plan is current, record `plan_source: vault` and its absolute path. If it has material drift or multiple approved candidates disagree, stop and ask the user to reopen `issue-plan`; never silently choose or rewrite one.
2. **Issue-as-plan fallback.** When no consumable vault plan exists, evaluate the current issue body, all comments, linked context, and `intake-inspection.md` against every clear-issue criterion in the handoff contract: outcome, boundary, acceptance, direction, and no unresolved load-bearing decisions. All five must pass. Record `plan_source: issue`, the issue/comment checkpoints, planning-base SHA, and a concise criterion-by-criterion verdict in `context.md`.
3. **Blocked.** If neither source passes, list the specific missing planning inputs, recommend `issue-plan {canonical-url}`, and stop. Do not continue to dirty-tree checks, create/reuse a worktree, edit code, or delegate implementation. Labels, assignment, milestone membership, or issue length never substitute for the rubric.

This is a readiness gate, not permission to publish. A clear issue authorizes detailed execution-plan synthesis but still follows Phase 2's approval checkpoint. A current vault plan whose handoff says `Planning status: approved` carries its prior plan approval forward unless Phase 2 materially changes its goal, scope, decisions, or acceptance contract.

### 1.6 Pre-flight checks

Run the remaining checks against the trunk (not a worktree). The default branch
was already resolved and fetched in Phase 1.4 so authority validation and the
eventual worktree use the same base.

```bash
# GitHub auth — stop if not logged in
gh auth status || { echo "Run: gh auth login"; exit 1; }

# Forgejo auth (only if forgejo ticket) — stop if no token in env
if [[ "$forge" == "forgejo" && -z "${FORGEJO_TOKEN:-${GITEA_TOKEN:-}}" ]]; then
  echo "Set FORGEJO_TOKEN (or GITEA_TOKEN) in your shell env" >&2
  exit 1
fi

# Working tree clean? (modified or staged — ignore untracked)
git -C "{TRUNK_ROOT}" status --porcelain | grep -E '^[ MADRC]'
```

If either auth check fails, stop and surface the error to the user — do not proceed to worktree creation. If the trunk is dirty (modified/staged, not just untracked), stop and offer: stash / commit / abort. Do not silently stash.

### 1.7 Create worktree

Use the [`worktrunk`](../worktrunk/SKILL.md) skill as the preferred controlled-worktree path.

1. **Compute slug, branch, and base.** `kebab-slug` = ticket title, lowercased, non-alphanumerics → `-`, collapsed, trimmed. Branch = `issue-{N}-{kebab-slug}` — or match the repo's convention if recent local branches show a different prefix. Base ref = `origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH`.
2. **Check for an existing worktree.** Run `wt list` (or `git worktree list --porcelain` when `wt` is unavailable) and reuse the matching branch; never nest worktrees.
3. **Create from the fetched base.** From `{TRUNK_ROOT}`, run `wt switch --create {branch} --base origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH`. If `wt` is unavailable, use the controlled fallback `git -C "{TRUNK_ROOT}" worktree add -b {branch} "{TRUNK_ROOT}.{N}-{kebab-slug}" origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH`.
4. **Operate in isolation.** Hermes runs subsequent file and terminal operations with the resulting absolute path as `workdir`; hosts with `EnterWorktree` may enter that path. Record it as `{WORKTREE_PATH}`.

Never switch the trunk checkout in place.

### 1.8 Write initial progress.md

```markdown
---
status: intake
ticket: {url-or-shorthand}
worktree: {abs-path}
branch: {branch-name}
base: {default-branch}
planning_base: {default-branch}
plan_source: {vault|issue}
source_plan: {absolute-vault-note-path-or-empty}
issue_checked_through: {forge-updated-timestamp}
comments_checkpoint: sha256:{digest}
planning_base_revision: {full-sha}

---

## Intake complete

- Context file: {TRUNK_ROOT}/.hermes/issue-work/{owner}-{repo}-{N}/context.md
- Worktree: {abs-path}
- Base branch: {default-branch}
- Base revision: {full-sha}
- Plan source: {approved vault note | clear issue}
```

---

## Phase 2 — Plan

### 2.1 Spawn parallel exploration

Decide how many exploration children to dispatch: **always** at least one; **add a second** if the ticket clearly spans two distinct areas. Use `delegate_task` on Hermes or `Task`/`Agent` elsewhere. Dispatch independent children together, with distinct output paths and no shared writes. If delegation is unavailable, perform the scopes serially.

Prompt template for each Explore agent:

> Map the codebase area relevant to ticket #{N}: "{title}".
>
> **Scope** (one of): {primary area | secondary area}
>
> Starting points (from ticket body/comments): {files, functions, modules mentioned}
>
> Produce a concise map:
> - Affected modules and files (with paths)
> - Existing patterns/abstractions worth reusing
> - Test locations and conventions in this area
> - Any gotchas or non-obvious coupling
>
> Write your findings to `{TRUNK_ROOT}/.hermes/issue-work/{owner}-{repo}-{N}/explore-{area-slug}.md` where `{area-slug}` is a short kebab-case tag for your assigned scope (e.g., `frontend`, `api`, `migration`). One file per agent — never share a file between Explore agents, since parallel appends can interleave and corrupt the output.

### 2.2 External research (conditional, inline)

If the ticket references libraries or APIs **not** present in the repo's manifests, do research inline.

First, discover which manifests exist in the repo:

```bash
# List manifests that actually exist at the repo root
for f in package.json go.mod Cargo.toml requirements.txt pyproject.toml Gemfile pom.xml build.gradle; do
  [[ -e "$f" ]] && echo "$f"
done
```

Then for each manifest found, grep its declared dependencies and compare against library names mentioned in the ticket. A library named in the ticket but absent from every manifest is a candidate for external research.

Use the host's read-only web search/fetch tools (Hermes browser/web tooling; Claude/OpenCode/Pi equivalents) to look up official docs. Capture findings directly in `plan.md` under a **Research** section. Do not create a separate agent or file.

### 2.3 Synthesize plan.md

> **Consumer- or plugin-author-facing surface? (soft pointer, judgment call.)** If this ticket introduces or reshapes a consumer/plugin-author-facing surface in the SGG / CommonGrants repos (a new endpoint, protocol/`.tsp` change, or SDK/extension surface), consider running the `dx-target` skill *before* delegating to plan authoring — it works backwards from the developer experience (2-3 candidate usage shapes → a chosen target) and hands the chosen target to `writing-plans` as the acceptance oracle, so the plan is "make this snippet real" rather than an inward-facing task list. Skip for endpoint bug-fixes, dep bumps, docs, and internal-only changes.

After exploration returns, load Hermes's installed `plan` skill or the host's equivalent plan-authoring workflow. Do not clone that skill's instructions here. Give it:

- **Inputs:** `context.md`, the `explore-*.md` outputs from 2.1, any inline research from 2.2, and the validated vault note when `plan_source: vault`.
- **Plan-path override:** `{TRUNK_ROOT}/.hermes/issue-work/{owner}-{repo}-{N}/plan.md`. Hermes `plan` normally writes under workspace `.hermes/plans/`; use this ticket-specific path so resume state stays together and never appears in the feature worktree's `git status`.

For a vault source, first compare exploration findings with its goal, scope,
accepted decisions, and acceptance contract. Any material mismatch is an
unconditional stop that routes back to `issue-plan`; do not synthesize a
superseding derived plan. Otherwise compile it into executor-ready tasks and
checkboxes rather than mutating the vault note. Record `plan_source: vault`,
`source_plan`, `source_plan_status: approved`, `source_plan_validated:
{iso8601}`, issue/comment checkpoints, and planning-base metadata in frontmatter.
For an issue source, synthesize the detailed execution plan from the issue's
planning authority and repository exploration, recording the same checkpoints
with `plan_source: issue`.

The result is a bite-sized, checkbox-task plan (exact file paths, code, evidence-shaped expected results, commit boundaries) — the shape Phase 3's executor consumes. Do not invent exact test counts or command output that was not run. Make sure frontmatter carries `status: planned` and `ticket: {url}` so Phase 0.2 resume and the 2.4 approval gate keep working against it.

### 2.4 Approval checkpoint

This is normally a hard stop. **Do not proceed to Phase 3 without explicit user approval or inherited approval from a current vault plan.**

When `plan_source: vault`, compare the derived plan against the approved source.
If synthesis only adds executor detail without changing the approved goal, scope,
decisions, or acceptance contract, record `approval: inherited` and the source
path in `plan.md`; present a concise validation/import summary and continue. Any
material change is an unconditional stop that routes back to `issue-plan`. It
cannot be approved only in the derived execution snapshot.

When `plan_source: issue`, present the full approval checkpoint:

Present the full `plan.md` contents inline to the user with a clear prompt:

> **Plan ready for review** — `{TRUNK_ROOT}/.hermes/issue-work/{owner}-{repo}-{N}/plan.md`
>
> {paste plan.md contents}
>
> Reply `approve` to begin implementation, or describe changes you'd like.

Then wait for the user's next message. Do not implement anything until you see an approval.

On an issue-sourced amendment, overwrite `plan.md` with the revised version, keep
`status: planned` in frontmatter, and re-present. Iterate until approved. For a
vault source, executor-only clarification may update the derived snapshot;
anything that changes goal, scope, decision, or acceptance routes back to
`issue-plan` without inline approval.

(If the harness happens to be in Plan Mode when this skill runs, `ExitPlanMode` is the harness-native approval gate and you can use it in place of the inline prompt above. Do not try to enter Plan Mode from inside the skill — that's not a thing.)

---

## Phase 3 — Implement

After user approval:

### 3.1 Update status

```bash
# Set progress.md frontmatter status: implementing
```

### 3.2 Execute the plan

`plan.md` (at the state-root path) is the source of truth. Mirror its checkboxes into the host task list (Hermes: `todo`). Then select exactly one execution path. This routing applies only inside `issue-work`; it does not prevent GPT from implementing ad hoc work outside this skill.

#### Hermes with a Codex-backed parent

Select the implementation engine after plan approval, in this order:

1. **Explicit same-run override.** Bryan may say GPT should implement this issue, or may explicitly select Qwen. Use that path. Claude remains limited to the verified SGG allowlist.
2. **SGG Claude allowlist.** Use `codex-claude-implementation-loop` only when the resolved origin host is `github.com` and the ticket owner/repository is exactly one of:
   - `HHS/simpler-grants-gov`
   - `HHS/simpler-grants-protocol`
   - `common-grants/py-cg-grants-gov`
   - `common-grants/ts-cg-grants-gov`
3. **Default planned-issue worker.** For every other repository, use `codex-qwen-implementation-loop`.

Resolve this decision with the skill's deterministic router, using `--override auto` unless Bryan explicitly selected GPT, Qwen, or an allowlisted Claude route:

```bash
python3 <issue-work-skill-dir>/scripts/select_issue_worker.py \
  --workdir "{WORKTREE_PATH}" \
  --ticket-repo "{owner}/{repo}" \
  --override auto
```

Load the exact skill named by `implementation_loop`; a `null` loop means the explicit host-native GPT path. Preserve the router JSON in the state directory as `implementation-routing.json`.

The intake owner/repository and the resolved clone's origin host plus owner/repository must agree before routing. A path under `~/code/sgg`, a similarly named checkout, a lookalike repository on another forge, or an unrelated repository under the SGG umbrella is not sufficient to authorize Claude. Missing worker prerequisites stop the run; never silently fall back to GPT, Claude, or a cloud model merely because the selected worker is unavailable.

For either delegated engine:

1. Record the worktree's baseline status and run the selected readiness command: Claude `claude_worker.py check`; Qwen `qwen_worker.py check`.
2. Invoke its `implement` command with `plan.md` and `{WORKTREE_PATH}`. The Claude path must select `--model opus`, run the wrapper's usage preflight, and may not downgrade. Surface any usage window over 75% as a warning. Above 85%, or when usage cannot be verified, stop and ask Bryan for an explicit same-run override before adding `--allow-high-usage`; plan approval is not that override. The Qwen path pins the wrapper's exact local provider and model and may not use a cloud fallback.
3. Save the normalized envelope as `{state-dir}/{worker}-implementation.json`. Record `implementation_loop:` and its `session_id` as `worker_session_id:` in `progress.md` frontmatter so Phase 4 can resume the same worker context.
4. Codex reviews the actual repository diff and independently reruns every targeted and broader check required by the plan. Worker JSON is evidence, not the verdict.
5. For blocking findings, write `{state-dir}/codex-review-{pass}.md` and resume the same worker session with its `revise` command. Repeat the complete Codex gate after each revision; cap the correction loop at two revision passes.
6. Mark plan/task checkboxes complete only after Codex accepts the final repository state. Preserve every implementation and revision envelope in the state directory.

The delegated worker must not stage, commit, push, reset, clean, publish, or alter history. After the complete Codex gate passes, the parent may create local commits at the approved plan's logical boundaries, staging only reviewed paths and preserving the repository's message and hook rules. Plan approval authorizes those local implementation commits; it does not authorize a push, PR, comment, or other publication.

When Bryan explicitly selects GPT implementation, execute task-by-task with the host-native workflow below while retaining the same plan, test, failure, and independent-review gates.

#### Other hosts or a non-Codex Hermes parent

Execute task-by-task with the host-native workflow. Load `test-driven-development` for behavior changes and `systematic-debugging` for failures. Pass through:

- **plan_path:** `{TRUNK_ROOT}/.hermes/issue-work/{owner}-{repo}-{N}/plan.md`
- **worktree path:** the absolute path from `progress.md`
- **commit rules:** atomic (one logical unit per commit); message style matches `git log --oneline -20` in **this repo** (not global defaults); **never** add `Co-authored-by: Claude` or any AI signature; **never** use `--no-verify`.
- **failure policy:** hand off the 3.5 escalation rule below — on a task whose tests fail, attempt a direct fix first; on a **second** consecutive failure of the same task, escalate per 3.5; hard cap at 3 attempts, then stop and report. Delegated Claude and Qwen paths instead use their two-revision bound above.

Keep `plan.md` checkboxes and the host task list synchronized, so a resumed run (`status: implementing`) picks up at the first unchecked task automatically.

### 3.3 Test / lint / typecheck reference

Run each task's own verification commands. When a task doesn't name one, fall back to detection by manifest:

| Manifest | Command |
|---|---|
| `package.json` with `test` script | `npm test` / `yarn test` / `pnpm test` (match lockfile) |
| `pyproject.toml` | `pytest` |
| `Cargo.toml` | `cargo test` |
| `go.mod` | `go test ./...` |
| `nx.json` / `turbo.json` | `nx affected -t test` or `turbo test` |

Lint + typecheck when configured: TypeScript `tsc --noEmit`; Python `ruff check` / `mypy`; Go `go vet ./...`; Rust `cargo clippy`.

### 3.5 On failure

On the host-native path, first failure of a task's tests: attempt a direct fix → commit → rerun. **Second consecutive failure of the same task:** escalate to `systematic-debugging` (the `Skill` tool) rather than guessing again — it drives a root-cause pass instead of another patch. **Hard cap at 3 attempts total.** On the 4th failure, stop and report the failing output to the user.

On either delegated path, Codex first determines whether the failure is a plan defect, implementation defect, pre-existing failure, or external blocker. Send implementation defects back through the same retained worker session under the two-revision bound. A plan defect, ambiguity, destructive conflict, unavailable selected worker, or exhausted revision budget stops for the user instead of switching workers or guessing.

### 3.6 Progress log

After each test run, append to `progress.md`:

```markdown
## {iso8601} — commit {sha7}

{one-line commit subject}

Tests: {pass/fail summary}
Lint/typecheck: {summary}
```

For either delegated path, also record the implementation/revision artifact path, worker-reported checks, Codex-rerun checks, and Codex gate verdict. Never collapse worker claims and Codex's fresh results into one line.

Do not advance `status` when tests go green — Phase 4 bumps it to `reviewed` after self-review completes. Leave it at `implementing` until then.

### 3.7 Repository planning closeout

Re-read the worktree's active project instructions. If they identify tracked
specs, plans, status notes, decision records, or other living planning
artifacts, reconcile them before self-review. Record completed milestones,
verified findings, changed assumptions, closed or newly opened questions, and
the next tracked work where applicable. These updates belong in the same
feature branch and PR as the implementation.

If no tracked planning artifact needs a change, record the inspected files and
the reason in `progress.md` under `## Planning closeout`. Do not proceed to
final verification until the required updates are in the diff or the no-update
rationale is recorded. External vault capture remains governed by
`vault-capture`; this gate covers repository-owned planning artifacts required
by project instructions.

### 3.8 Verify before handing off

Before Phase 4 spawns review, prove the suite is green rather than trust the implementation context. If Phase 3 used either delegated implementation loop, its final Codex review/retest gate satisfies this step; cite that fresh gate output rather than spawning a duplicate generic reviewer, and rerun only checks invalidated by the parent's post-gate local commit operation. Otherwise load `requesting-code-review` on Hermes (or the host's independent verification workflow), rerun the project's test / lint / typecheck commands, and preserve actual output.

Append the result to `progress.md` under a `## Verification` heading:

```markdown
## Verification

- {iso8601}
- Command(s): {what ran}
- Result: {pass/fail summary + key output lines}
```

If verification fails, do **not** advance to Phase 4. Return to Phase 3's failure loop (3.5) with the new output. Phase 4 starts only once verification is green.

---

## Phase 4 — Self-Review

### 4.1 Delegate to `/pr-self-review`

Phase 4 hands off to the [`pr-self-review`](../pr-self-review/SKILL.md) skill in its `pre-pr` mode — all four review lenses, plus a pre-review context fetch and agent-owned finding disposition. The agent automatically fixes validated in-scope findings, rejects false positives, and defers demonstrably separate non-blocking work. It asks the user only when a valid blocking finding has no reasonable fix that preserves the approved PR intent. Hermes runs the four lenses in batches of at most three children; other hosts may run all four concurrently. The worktree, branch, and state dir already exist; pass them in:

- `mode`: `pre-pr`
- `state_dir`: `{TRUNK_ROOT}/.hermes/issue-work/{owner}-{repo}-{N}/`
- `worktree_path`: the absolute path from `progress.md`
- `head_branch`: the value from `progress.md` `branch:`; pr-self-review uses it for branch-drift checks because no PR-derived `headRefName` exists yet
- `base_branch`: the value from `progress.md` `base:`
- `plan_path`: `{TRUNK_ROOT}/.hermes/issue-work/{owner}-{repo}-{N}/plan.md`
- `source_issue`: `{owner}/{repo}#{N}` — the ticket this work is for; lets pr-self-review treat findings tagged with this issue as PR-intent findings rather than separately tracked work, without waiting for a PR body to exist yet.
- `worker_session_id`: the value recorded in `progress.md` when Phase 3 used a delegated implementation loop; otherwise omit it.
- `implementation_loop`: the exact selected value, `codex-claude-implementation-loop` or `codex-qwen-implementation-loop`, when `worker_session_id` is present; otherwise omit it.

Load the skill through the host's skill mechanism. It writes `review-{lens}.md` files and a final `summary.md` into the state dir, matching the shape Phase 4.3 reads below.

After the skill returns, inspect `summary.md` Ship Readiness. If it says `Correction bound reached — do not merge`, set `progress.md` `status: blocked`, present the remaining correction-bound findings, and stop without entering Phase 4.3 or asking for ship approval. Otherwise set `progress.md` `status: reviewed` and continue.

### 4.3 Present to user and ask for ship approval

Present the review outcome inline in this order:

1. **Headline** — the one-line summary from `summary.md`.
2. **Critical + Major findings** — full bullets, not just counts. If none, say so explicitly ("No critical or major findings").
3. **Minor / Nit counts** — single line, e.g. "Minor: 3, Nit: 1. Full detail in review-*.md."
4. **Paths** — `summary.md` + individual `review-{lens}.md` files, as clickable Markdown links when the surface supports them.
5. **Ship prompt.** End the message with a direct question — do not stop silently:

   > Ready to push the branch and open the draft PR? Reply `ship it` to proceed, or flag anything you want changed first.

   On `ship it` (or equivalent approval like "yes", "go", "push"): **load the [`ship` skill](../ship/SKILL.md)** — do not run `git push` / `gh pr create` directly. `ship` preserves draft-PR defaults, forge-specific creation, PR-template fidelity, and labels.

   When invoking `/ship`, tell it the authoritative source for what the PR is about lives at `{TRUNK_ROOT}/.hermes/issue-work/{owner}-{repo}-{N}/summary.md` — `/ship` reads that file when filling the PR template's Summary and Test-plan sections so the PR body reflects the review findings, not a generic diff-walk.

   On anything ambiguous: ask again, do not ship. Do not treat silence as approval.

**Do not auto-ship before this exchange.** The review summary on its own isn't consent — the user needs one more explicit step after reading it.

## Edge Cases

| Case | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Worktree already exists for this ticket | Reuse it after `wt list` / `git worktree list`; resume from `progress.md` status |
| Trunk dirty (modified/staged) | Stop. List files. Offer stash / commit / abort |
| Ticket is a PR (review work, not new work) | Fetch the PR head, create/reuse a controlled `wt` worktree without switching trunk, swap Phase 3 for "review against plan"; Phase 4 reviewers still run |
| Tests fail (2nd time on a task) | Escalate to `systematic-debugging`; hard cap 3 attempts, then stop and surface output |
| Critical review findings | Present prominently; recommend fix-before-ship; never auto-ship |
| User amends an issue-sourced plan | Overwrite `plan.md`; reset status `planned`; re-present inline and await approval again (see Phase 2.4) |
| User materially amends a vault-sourced plan | Stop and route to `issue-plan`; never supersede the canonical vault authority in derived state |
| Approved vault plan is current | Import/compile it, record freshness validation, and inherit approval when no material planning contract changed |
| Vault plan has material drift | Stop before worktree creation and route back to `issue-plan`; do not patch the vault note during intake |
| No approved vault plan, but issue passes all five criteria | Record `plan_source: issue`, continue to exploration/synthesis, and use the normal Phase 2.4 approval gate |
| Neither vault plan nor issue passes | List missing criteria, recommend `issue-plan {url}`, and stop before dirty-tree checks/worktree/implementation |
| Legacy resume state lacks plan-source/checkpoint metadata | Do not reuse its worktree; refresh intake and validate authority first |
| Repo not cloned locally | Ask before `gh repo clone` to `~/code/{repo}` |
| Forgejo ticket | Intake uses the REST API in `references/fetch-ticket.md`; everything else is identical |
| Pasted raw text (no URL) | Skip fetch; ask user for repo; `context.md` has only Body |
| User says "refresh" on a resumed ticket | Overwrite prior state files; restart from Phase 1 |

## Things This Skill Does NOT Do

- Ship without explicit approval — Phase 4.3's ship gate is mandatory; silence is not consent. On `ship it` the skill hands off to `/ship`, which handles the push + PR creation.
- Modify files outside the worktree and the state dir. Approved project-vault plans are read-only inputs; vault changes route through `issue-plan` or `vault-capture`.
- Add AI signatures to commits or PRs
- Skip hooks (`--no-verify`) or bypass signing
- Create or silently amend external vault notes. It may read an approved
  `issue-plan` note and derive state under `{TRUNK_ROOT}/.hermes/issue-work/`.
  Repository-owned planning artifacts required by project instructions are
  implementation files and follow the Phase 3.7 closeout gate.

- `codex-qwen-implementation-loop` — default non-SGG Phase 3 implementation/revision engine for planned issue work on a Codex-backed Hermes parent.

### Optional Delegation

Soft references — the skill works without them, but if the host environment has them installed they can be invoked on demand during a run:

- `engineering:debug` — optional alternative to `systematic-debugging` at Phase 3.5, if that environment-specific debugger is installed and preferred
- `engineering:testing-strategy` — optional, when Phase 2 exploration surfaces a test-architecture gap deep enough to warrant its own plan
