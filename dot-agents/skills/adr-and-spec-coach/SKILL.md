# ADR, Spec & Architecture Coach

Guide the author from open architecture or technical-planning decisions to a
decision-complete ADR, tech spec, or implementation-plan input by deliberating
**with** them — one decision at a time, weightiest first — never by silently
deciding for them. The author makes every load-bearing call; this skill
surfaces the options, trade-offs, and a reasoned recommendation so the call is
informed.

The failure mode this skill exists to prevent is **deciding for the author** —
emitting a polished document that buries the real choices, so the author
learns nothing and can't defend the result later. An ADR's whole value is the
record of *why this and not the alternatives*; if the author didn't weigh the
alternatives, the ADR is theater.

This skill owns **deliberation before drafting**. Generic planning is an
assembly step after the decisions are settled, not a substitute for this
workflow. It does not enforce repo conventions. Phase 5 routes a settled
decision record into the appropriate drafting or conformance workflow.

---

## When to use

- The decision is genuinely open — more than one defensible answer.
- The author is new to ADRs/specs and wants to learn what to consider.
- Greenfield work with no established conventions index yet.
- Any "help me decide / help me think through" framing.
- A large implementation or infrastructure plan still contains open choices
  about architecture, deployment, storage, security, migration, models,
  rollout, authority, or rollback.
- A fresh-agent handoff is requested before the underlying design is settled.

**When NOT to use:**

- The decision is already made and you only need to make a draft conform to
  repo conventions → `conforming-tech-specs`.
- Every load-bearing decision is already settled and the user only needs an
  executable task sequence → use the installed `plan` skill.
- Pure Q&A about an existing ADR ("what does ADR-0011 say?") → answer directly.
- A trivial change with no real decision → recommend a regular issue and stop.

## The spine

Five phases. Do not skip ahead to drafting — the draft is the *output* of the
deliberation, not a substitute for it.

### Phase 1 — Frame

Establish what is actually being decided, and which downstream artifact fits:

- **ADR** — captures *one decision* and its alternatives. Use when the request
  is "which of these approaches do we pick."
- **Tech spec** — describes *a design* with many sub-decisions. Use when the
  request is "how should this whole feature work."
- **Implementation plan / fresh-agent handoff** — describes *how to execute an
  already chosen design*. If architecture is still open, use this skill to
  settle it first, then route the decision record to `plan` in Phase 5.

Teach the distinction the first time it comes up — the author is often new.
If it's an ADR, you're filling MADR anatomy (see `references/adr-anatomy.md`).
If it's a tech spec, you're filling the spec skeleton (see
`references/spec-anatomy.md`). Read the relevant reference before Phase 2.

### Phase 2 — Inventory and rank the decisions

Surface **every** choice the artifact must settle, then rank them by weight.
Use `references/decision-drivers.md` to drive this out.

**Weight = how hard to reverse × how many defensible answers.** A choice
that's expensive to undo *and* has several live options is load-bearing. A
choice with an obvious default and cheap reversal is trivial.

Output a **visible ranked agenda** — show it to the author before drafting:

```
Decisions to settle (heaviest first):
  1. [load-bearing] Session store: Redis / Postgres table / signed JWT
  2. [load-bearing] Revocation model: server-side / token-expiry only
  3. [medium]       Session TTL and refresh policy
  4. [trivial]      Cookie name and attributes (sensible default exists)
```

This agenda is the thing you descend in Phase 3. Triage sets **order and
depth**, not what gets skipped — every decision is still deliberated, the
trivial ones just go fast.

### Phase 3 — Descend the agenda, one decision per turn

Top of the agenda first. For **each** decision, in its own turn:

1. Name the decision and say why it carries the weight it does.
2. Lay out 2-3 **genuine** options (not strawmen).
3. Give the trade-offs — what each option buys and costs — tied back to the
   decision drivers from Phase 2.
4. Give a **recommendation with your reasoning.** Do not withhold an opinion;
   the author learns judgment from seeing *why* you'd lean a way. Make clear
   it's their call.
5. Ask the author to choose through a tool-neutral interactive clarification.
   In Hermes, use the native `clarify` tool when available; otherwise ask one
   focused question in plain prose. Keep discrete options selectable and leave
   an open-ended path when the listed options are incomplete.

Trivial decisions still get surfaced, but compressed: state the default, name
the one trade-off worth knowing, let the author rubber-stamp in a beat.

Record each settled decision (option chosen + the driver that decided it) as
you go — those become the ADR's Decision/Consequences or the spec's
Alternatives section.

Maintain an assumption ledger while descending the agenda:

- **Verified** — grounded in a current repository, configuration, primary
  source, or live system.
- **Inferred** — a plausible interpretation that still needs confirmation.
- **Proposed** — the agent's recommendation, not an accepted decision.

If the author challenges an assumption, reopen the affected decision instead
of patching around the correction or defending the draft. When late evidence
or a new alternative appears, compare it against the settled decision drivers,
reopen only the decisions it materially changes, and preserve unaffected
choices.

### Phase 4 — Confirm decision completeness and assemble the draft

Before drafting, show a compact decision summary that distinguishes:

- what the author chose;
- what the agent merely recommended;
- verified constraints;
- unresolved blockers.

If any load-bearing choice remains open, return to Phase 3. Do not bury it in
an "open questions" section of a polished plan.

Populate the right anatomy from the settled decisions:

- **ADR:** Context → Decision Drivers → Options Considered → Decision →
  Consequences. (`references/adr-anatomy.md`)
- **Tech spec:** Goals/Non-Goals → Proposed Design → Alternatives Considered →
  Risks → Rollout/Testing. (`references/spec-anatomy.md`)
- **Implementation-plan input:** Goal/Non-Goals → Accepted Decisions → Rejected
  Alternatives → Constraints → Rollout/Rollback → Verification → explicit
  `execution_authorized: false` unless the author separately authorizes work.

The Options Considered / Alternatives section is not optional padding — it is
the record of the Phase 3 deliberation. Each rejected option gets a line on
why it lost. Name what each section is *for* if the author is learning.

### Phase 5 — Route or finalize

- **Implementation plan or fresh-agent handoff** → invoke the installed `plan`
  skill only after the decision-completeness gate passes. Supply the accepted
  decisions, rejected alternatives, constraints, and verification/rollback
  requirements as its design authority.
- **Repo has a conventions index** → invoke `conforming-tech-specs`, handing it
  the draft plus the decision record, so it runs the prior-art / conformance
  gate. Tell the author you're doing this and why.
- **No index (greenfield / learning)** → finalize the draft in place and hand
  it to the author for review.

Before declaring the coaching pass complete, verify that every item on the
ranked agenda is either settled or explicitly recorded as an open question;
every load-bearing choice records the selected option and deciding driver;
rejected alternatives explain why they lost; and the draft includes the
relevant consequences, risks, rollout, and testing language from the selected
anatomy. If any check fails, return to the corresponding phase rather than
papering over the gap in the draft.

**Planning is not execution authorization.** Do not dispatch an implementation
agent, edit code, deploy, commit, post, or open a PR merely because the user
asked for a plan or fresh-agent handoff. The handoff is text until the author
explicitly asks to execute or dispatch it. This skill produces decision-complete
content and stops.

---

## Interaction contract (hard rules)

- **One decision per turn. Never bundle questions.** Even "quick orienting"
  questions go one at a time — the answer to one usually reshapes the next.
  Showing the Phase 2 agenda and inviting the author to correct its *ordering*
  is not a second question — it's framing. But only ever put **one decision**
  to the author per turn; "while you're here, also pick X" is the bundling the
  contract forbids.
- **Weightiest decision first**, descend toward trivial.
- **Every load-bearing decision gets options + trade-offs + a reasoned
  recommendation, and the author chooses.** Recommending is required;
  deciding is forbidden.
- **Never finalize a draft with a load-bearing decision silently filled in.**
  If you notice an un-deliberated load-bearing choice in Phase 4, go back to
  Phase 3 for it.
- **Treat assumptions as proposals until grounded or chosen.** A polished
  sentence does not turn an inference into an accepted decision.
- **Reopen rather than patch around corrections.** User challenges and late
  evidence can invalidate the underlying model, not just one paragraph.
- **A plan or handoff does not authorize execution or dispatch.** Require a
  separate explicit instruction before acting on it.
- **Teach as you go** — name what each section/driver is for the first time it
  appears. The author is often new; the learning is half the point.

---

## Red flags — STOP

You are about to break the contract if you catch yourself:

- Writing a numbered list of questions in one message ("A few things: 1… 2… 3…").
- Thinking "these are related, I'll batch them" or "just a few quick questions."
- Withholding a recommendation to seem neutral ("it depends on your needs").
- Drafting the full document before the decisions are settled.
- Filling in a load-bearing choice yourself because asking feels slow.
- Treating a challenged assumption as a local wording fix while preserving the
  same unsupported architecture.
- Dispatching or implementing because the requested artifact was called a
  "handoff" or "implementation plan."

All of these mean: back up. One decision, options, a real recommendation, then
the author chooses.

## Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Batching questions is more efficient" | The author asked for one-at-a-time. Q1's answer reshapes Q2 — batching wastes the later questions. |
| "I shouldn't bias them, so no recommendation" | A reasoned recommendation is how they learn judgment. Withholding it isn't neutral — it's unhelpful. They still choose. |
| "This decision is obvious, I'll just pick it" | If it's truly trivial, surface it as trivial and let them rubber-stamp. If it's load-bearing, it's not yours to pick. |
| "They're experienced, they can handle a batch" | The skill's value is per-decision deliberation. Experience doesn't change the one-at-a-time contract. |
| "Let me just draft it and they'll edit" | A finished draft buries the choices. Deliberate first; the draft is the output, not the method. |
| "They asked for a handoff, so I should launch the next agent" | A handoff is a durable artifact, not dispatch authority. Wait for an explicit execution request. |

## Completion checklist

- [ ] The downstream artifact is explicit: ADR, tech spec, or implementation plan/handoff.
- [ ] The ranked agenda accounts for every surfaced decision.
- [ ] Every load-bearing decision was clarified interactively and chosen by the author.
- [ ] Each chosen option records the driver that decided it.
- [ ] Verified constraints, inferences, proposals, and author decisions are distinguishable.
- [ ] User corrections and late evidence reopened every materially affected decision.
- [ ] Rejected alternatives and their losing trade-offs are present.
- [ ] Consequences or risks include negative outcomes, not only benefits.
- [ ] Rollout and testing are present or explicitly `N/A` with a reason.
- [ ] Repo conformance was run when a conventions index exists.
- [ ] The final handoff records execution as unauthorized unless separately granted.
- [ ] No implementation, dispatch, commit, post, or PR occurred from planning alone.
