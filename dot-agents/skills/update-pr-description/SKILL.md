# Update PR Description

Update a pull request description by following whatever template instructions exist in the PR body and including a summary of changes from the diff. Supports both GitHub and Forgejo forges.

---

## Input

Accepts either:

- PR number: `update-pr-description 42170`
- PR URL: `update-pr-description https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42170`
- PR URL (Forgejo): `update-pr-description https://git.example.com/owner/repo/pulls/1`
- Nothing (will detect PR from current branch)

---

## Step 0: Detect Forge

Determine which forge hosts this repo via the shared [forge-detection reference](../ship/references/forge-detection.md) — it sets `forge` to `github`, `forgejo`, or `unknown`. On `unknown`, error out with the supported-forge list (see the "Forge not detected" error below).

### Forgejo: URL Parsing

Use the host and `owner_repo` returned by the shared parser. Run authenticated
`tea api` with explicit `--login` and `--repo` values. If Tea cannot read the
current checkout because of `extensions.worktreeconfig`, use the temporary
initialized-repository pattern documented by `ship`; do not fall back to token
scraping.

If a PR URL is provided (e.g. `https://codeberg.org/owner/repo/pulls/1`),
extract the PR index from path segment 4.

---

## Step 1: Identify the PR

### If PR number/URL provided:

Parse the input to extract the PR number and repo (if URL provided).

### If no argument provided:

**GitHub:**

```bash
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
gh pr list --head "$BRANCH" --json number,title,url,body --limit 1
```

**Forgejo:**

```bash
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
tea api --login {login} --repo {owner/repo} \
  "/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls?state=open" \
  | jq -c --arg branch "$BRANCH" '.[] | select(.head.ref == $branch) | {number: .number, title: .title, url: .html_url, body: .body}' \
  | head -1
```

---

## Step 2: Fetch PR Details and Diff

**GitHub:**

```bash
gh pr view {number} \
  --repo {org}/{repo} \
  --json number,title,url,body,baseRefName

git diff {baseRefName}...HEAD --stat
git diff {baseRefName}...HEAD
```

**Forgejo:**

```bash
# Run from a Tea-safe context; replace placeholders with parsed values.
tea api --login {login} --repo {owner/repo} \
  "/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{index}" \
  | jq '{number: .number, title: .title, url: .html_url, body: .body, baseRefName: .base.ref}'

# Get the diff (same git commands for both forges)
git diff {baseRefName}...HEAD --stat
git diff {baseRefName}...HEAD
```

---

## Step 3: Read the Template

The PR body contains the repository's template. Read it carefully:

1. **Look for instructions** at the top (often says to delete placeholder text)
2. **Identify sections** (Summary, Testing, Related Issues, etc.)
3. **Find placeholders** - usually in italics, parentheses, or marked as `_(placeholder)_`
4. **Note checkboxes** - which need to be filled `[x]` or justified

**Follow whatever instructions the template provides.**

---

## Step 4: Generate Updated Description

Fill the template (read from the PR body in Step 3) following the shared fill discipline in [../ship/references/pr-body-fill.md](../ship/references/pr-body-fill.md) — follow the template's own instructions, strip `>` / `<!-- -->` / placeholder text, fill every section with no empties, check/justify boxes (`[x]` or `_N/A - reason_`), and link issues from the branch name / commits / original body.

The **source material** here is the diff from Step 2 — this skill has no summary artifact, so drive every section factually from the diff.

Do not add AI attribution, generated-by notices, or `Co-authored-by` text. Preserve factual issue links and the repository template exactly.

### Step 4.5: Approval gate

Updating a PR body is public communication and requires authorization. A user's
explicit approval of work for an existing PR satisfies this gate when the user
has established that approval includes keeping that PR description synchronized,
and the update only makes the body accurately reflect the approved work. In that
case, do not ask again: update the body and read it back. This scoped authorization
does not cover comments, issue edits, review requests, merges, or new claims
outside the approved work.

Otherwise, present the complete generated description inline and ask for explicit
approval using interactive clarification (Hermes: `clarify`) or the host's
conversational equivalent. Iterate on requested edits and re-present. **Do not call
`gh pr edit`, `tea api`, or the Forgejo REST API until the user approves the exact
body.** Silence and ambiguity are not approval. In unattended runs without the
standing authorization above, write/report the proposed body and stop without
mutating the PR.

---

## Step 5: Update the PR

Proceed only after Step 4.5 approval.

**GitHub:**

```bash
gh pr edit {number} --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
{generated description}
EOF
)"
```

**Forgejo:**

Use `tea api` with explicit login/repository context, `-X PATCH`, and `-f`
for string fields. Replace `{index}` with the actual PR number.

```bash
# Update body only
tea api --login {login} --repo {owner/repo} -X PATCH "/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{index}" \
  -f "body={generated description}"

# Update both title and body
tea api --login {login} --repo {owner/repo} -X PATCH "/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{index}" \
  -f "title={new title}" \
  -f "body={generated description}"
```

**IMPORTANT**: `tea` does NOT have a `pr edit` subcommand. `tea api` is
the correct way to update PR title/body on Forgejo. Do NOT attempt
`tea pr edit` — it does not exist.

---

## Step 6: Confirm Completion

Report:

```
Updated PR #{number}: {title}
   {url}
```

---

## Error Handling

### PR not found

```
Could not find PR #{number}
   Verify the PR exists and you have access.
```

### Cannot determine current PR

```
No PR found for current branch: {branch}
   Please provide a PR number: update-pr-description <number>
```

### Forge not detected

```
Could not detect forge from remote URL: {remote_url}
   Supported forges: GitHub (github.com), Forgejo/Gitea/Codeberg (forgejo/gitea/codeberg/snowboardtechie in URL)
```

### tea not authenticated (Forgejo)

```
tea CLI not authenticated. Run: tea login add
   Or set FORGEJO_TOKEN environment variable.
```

## Related

Three skills touch a PR; they don't overlap:

- `ship` — fills the description **at creation** (and refuses if a PR already exists). Create-time only.
- `update-pr-description` (this skill) — re-syncs an **existing** PR's body to its current diff + template, on demand. The only tool for updating a PR body after it's opened.
- `pr-self-review` — reviews a PR and writes `summary.md`; it pushes fix commits but never edits the PR body.

No superpowers/GSD delegation — this is a forge-API utility, not a dev-lifecycle skill.
