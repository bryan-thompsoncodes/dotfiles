# Global Instructions

- Never add `Co-Authored-By: Claude` (or any Claude-as-author) trailer to commit messages or PR descriptions.
- When creating PRs, default to draft (`gh pr create --draft`). Use the repo's PR template (`.github/pull_request_template.md`) if present. Never commit to main directly — verify `git branch --show-current` first. **Carve-outs (direct push to main is sanctioned):** (1) `~/code/dotfiles/` and `~/code/nix-configs/` are solo personal infra with no branch protection. (2) **Forgejo/Codeberg repos** (origin on `codeberg.org` or a Forgejo host such as `git.snowboardtechie.com`): approved PRs are merged *manually* — squash the reviewed, CI-green branch onto main locally and `git push origin main` directly — because server-side merge would re-sign and invalidate commit signatures. There, the direct push to main IS the merge step (not a review bypass) once the PR is reviewed and CI is green; afterward, mark the PR merged via the Forgejo API (`Do: manually-merged`).
- **Default PR title and branch naming (all repos).** Unless the repo's own contributing guidelines / AGENTS.md say otherwise, those override:
  - **PR titles:** conventional-commit style, the format release-please parses — `type(scope): imperative summary` (`fix(core): ...`, `feat(api): ...`, `docs: ...`). Never `[Issue #N] Description`. Issue linkage goes in the body (`Fixes #N`).
  - **Branch names:** `bryan/<issue-id>-<subject>` — the user prefix is always `bryan` (not the GitHub handle `SnowboardTechie`), e.g. `bryan/1026-org-patch-composition`. Drop the id when there's no related issue: `bryan/<subject>`.
  - Before titling or branching in an unfamiliar repo, check `CONTRIBUTING.md` and recent merged PR titles; a repo's stated convention wins over this default.
- The user's project agent notes live in `AGENTS.md`, with `CLAUDE.md` as a symlink to it so the harness's CLAUDE.md autoload picks up the same content. Both filenames are in the user's global gitignore (`~/.config/git/ignore`) and should stay there. Don't propose creating a separate (non-symlink) `CLAUDE.md` alongside an existing `AGENTS.md`, don't suggest tracking either file, and don't suggest removing the global ignore.
- Preserve links when summarizing or re-sharing content (plan files, daily notes, PR/issue bodies). Don't strip markdown links to bare identifiers (`#740`, `PR #755`) — the user clicks them.

## Project vaults & personal vaults

Several repos under `~/code/` have a top-level `vault/` directory (symlinked to
`~/code/notes/<project>/`). Also `~/second-brain/` is Bryan's personal-knowledge
vault. When working in any of these — or when capturing decisions, taking notes,
investigating debugs, recording learnings, or making sense of project context
that doesn't live in code — invoke the `vault-pkm` skill before writing anything
to a vault.

If a vault has its own `AGENTS.md` at its root (`vault/AGENTS.md` for project
vaults; `~/second-brain/AGENTS.md` for the personal vault), read it after the
skill — it overrides skill defaults for that specific vault.
