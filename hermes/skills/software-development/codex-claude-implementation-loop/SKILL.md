# Codex–Claude Implementation Loop

## Overview

Keep authority with the Codex-backed Hermes parent while using Claude Code as a
subscription-backed background implementation worker. This wrapper is
explicit-request-only; normal visible coding handoffs use
`coding-agent-handoff-supervision` through Herdr.

**Ownership:** Codex plans, reviews, independently tests, and decides whether work is complete. Claude implements, runs the first test pass, and revises its work when Codex returns concrete findings.

```text
Codex plans → Claude implements/tests → Codex reviews/retests
                    ↑                         │
                    └──── actionable fixes ──┘
```

The loop is sequential: never let Codex and Claude edit the same working tree concurrently.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- The user explicitly requests this background wrapper for the current run.
- The active Hermes parent uses an OpenAI Codex subscription model.
- A non-trivial coding task is ready for implementation.
- The user asks for Codex planning with Claude implementation.
- Independent cross-model review is valuable before reporting completion.

Do not use for:

- Automatic routing or as a fallback when a visible Herdr handoff is unavailable.
- Planning-only requests.
- Read-only research or explanation.
- Tiny edits where process overhead exceeds risk, unless the user explicitly requests the loop.
- Repositories with unresolved destructive operations or secrets that Claude must not access.

## Invariants

1. **Codex owns the plan and final verdict.** Claude never declares the overall task complete.
2. **Repository state is authoritative.** Treat Claude's summary as a lead; verify files and tests directly.
3. **Subscription only.** The worker refuses to run when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is present and never uses `--bare`.
4. **No publication.** Claude must not commit, push, open PRs, post comments, or publish artifacts.
5. **Preserve user work.** Snapshot the initial status and never overwrite, discard, stage, or clean unrelated changes.
6. **Bounded loop.** Allow at most two revision passes after the initial implementation unless the user explicitly extends it.
7. **Fail closed.** Authentication failure, invalid JSON, missing session ID, unexplained file changes, or unverified tests blocks completion.
8. **Opus primary selection.** Claude implementation and revision passes select Opus. A non-Opus primary model requires the user's explicit confirmation and the wrapper's `--allow-non-opus` acknowledgement; overload never authorizes a silent downgrade. When the user requires literal model purity, load `coding-agent-model-purity`: `--model opus` alone does not prove that internal helpers used only Opus.
9. **Separate contract and engineering reviews.** Acceptance-criteria traceability and passing tests do not establish code quality. Codex must complete a distinct engineering review for quality, security, simplicity, maintainability, and test quality before calling a diff approval-ready.
10. **Usage-aware handoffs.** Run Claude's zero-turn `/usage` preflight before every check, implementation, and revision invocation. Warn when any reported window is over 75% used. Above 85%, or when usage cannot be verified, stop unless Bryan explicitly overrides that invocation with `--allow-high-usage`.

## Prerequisites

Before planning, verify:

```bash
claude --version
claude auth status --text
```

The login method must be a Claude subscription account such as Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise. If `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set, stop and tell the user the worker would risk API billing.

The wrapper also runs Claude's local `/usage` command with zero tools and verifies that it consumed zero turns and zero reported cost. Its normalized `usage_preflight` field includes every reported usage window. A `warning` verdict above 75% is visible but does not stop the handoff. Usage above 85% fails closed; only explicit same-run user approval permits rerunning with `--allow-high-usage`. Treat an unavailable or unparsable usage result the same way rather than silently skipping the gate. The thresholds are strict `>` comparisons, so exactly 75% is normal and exactly 85% warns without blocking.

If the user says one model must be used "throughout," forbids helper or fallback models, or otherwise requires literal model purity, load `coding-agent-model-purity` before execution. Record raw model-usage metadata and treat any observed nonconforming model as non-compliant, independently of code quality.

Locate this skill's worker through the loaded skill path. The normal user-local location is:

```text
~/.hermes/skills/software-development/codex-claude-implementation-loop/scripts/claude_worker.py
```

Use the actual path reported by `skill_view` if the skill is installed elsewhere.

## Phase 1 — Codex Plans

### 1. Establish the baseline

From the repository root, inspect:

```bash
git status --short
git branch --show-current
git diff --stat
git diff
```

Record all pre-existing changed and untracked paths. Do not ask Claude to modify those paths unless the task explicitly requires it and the user changes are understood.

**Completion criterion:** the parent can distinguish pre-existing work from changes expected by the plan.

### 2. Inspect before designing

Read project context and trace relevant symbols, tests, manifests, and neighboring conventions. Do not make Claude rediscover requirements that Codex can state precisely.

**Completion criterion:** every proposed file and API has been observed in the repository; no invented symbols or dependencies remain in the plan.

### 3. Write an implementation contract

Create a temporary plan file outside the repository or under an already-ignored `.hermes/plans/` directory. Include:

- Goal and non-goals
- Acceptance criteria
- Exact files or components in scope
- Required behavior and edge cases
- Test-first steps where practical
- Exact targeted and broader test commands
- Project constraints from `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or equivalent
- Explicit prohibition on commit, push, reset, clean, and unrelated refactors

Do not include secrets. Do not rely on conversation history: Claude receives only the plan, repository, and its own project context.

**Completion criterion:** a competent implementer with no parent-chat context could execute the plan without guessing.

## Phase 2 — Claude Implements and Tests

Run the worker from the repository root:

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/claude_worker.py implement \
  --workdir "$PWD" \
  --plan /absolute/path/to/plan.md \
  --model opus
```

If and only if Bryan explicitly overrides a reported high-usage or unavailable-usage block for this invocation, append `--allow-high-usage`. Do not persist the override or infer it from earlier approval of the implementation plan. Revisions rerun the usage check and require a fresh explicit override whenever they remain above the block threshold.

Always use `--model opus` for implementation and revision. Do not fall back or downgrade to Sonnet, Haiku, or another primary model after overload, throttling, or model unavailability. Stop and ask the user first. After explicit confirmation, a non-Opus invocation must also include `--allow-non-opus`.

`--model opus` proves primary-model selection only. Under a literal-purity requirement, preserve and inspect the most detailed available model-usage metadata for internal helpers, delegated agents, summarizers, or routing. Do not report compliance from the command flag or normalized worker result alone.

The worker starts Claude Code in print mode with editing tools, structured output, a bounded turn count, and explicit prohibitions against Git publication/history changes. It loads project/local Claude settings while excluding user-level plugins and hooks so personal Claude extensions do not create repository artifacts or consume worker turns. It returns a normalized JSON envelope containing `session_id` and `worker_result`.

After Claude returns:

1. Save the `session_id`; revisions must resume this session.
2. Read `worker_result.status`, but do not trust it as the final verdict.
3. If Claude reports `blocked` or `failed`, inspect the blocker. Codex either repairs the plan, asks the user, or stops.
4. Compare `git status --short` with the baseline immediately.
5. Stop if Claude touched unrelated pre-existing work or performed an unexplained broad change.
6. When strict purity applies, classify execution as certified, uncertified, non-compliant, or blocked using `coding-agent-model-purity`; keep this verdict separate from implementation correctness.

**Completion criterion:** Claude produced a parseable result with a session ID, and every changed path is either planned or explicitly explained.

## Phase 3 — Codex Reviews and Retests

Codex now performs an independent gate. Do not delegate this gate back to Claude.

### 1. Pass A: verify the implementation contract

Inspect the complete diff and relevant files for contract compliance. Check:

- Every acceptance criterion is implemented.
- Behavior matches the plan rather than merely Claude's summary.
- Every changed path is planned or explicitly justified.
- No unrelated refactor, generated debris, secret, or debug output appeared.
- Existing user changes remain intact.

Record any unmet or ambiguous criterion. Do not treat a clean contract pass as code approval.

**Completion criterion:** every acceptance criterion and changed path is accounted for, independently of the engineering-quality verdict.

### 2. Pass B: perform a separate engineering review

Start a second pass over the full diff from an engineering-review perspective rather than walking the acceptance checklist again. Evaluate each lens explicitly:

- **Quality and correctness:** API design, control flow, error handling, boundary behavior, typing, naming, readability, and consistency with neighboring code.
- **Security and privacy:** untrusted inputs, validation, authentication and authorization, secret handling, injection risks, unsafe network or filesystem behavior, data exposure, and dependency implications. A package audit is evidence about known dependency advisories, not a security review of the diff.
- **Simplicity:** unnecessary abstractions, duplication, over-engineering, speculative flexibility, excessive fixtures, and whether a smaller change would be clearer.
- **Maintainability:** coupling, public-surface consequences, documentation drift, future failure modes, and whether the implementation is easy to modify safely.
- **Test quality:** behavioral coverage, regression sensitivity, false-positive risks, assertion strength, realistic seams, cleanup/isolation, and whether tests merely mirror the implementation.

For each lens, record actionable findings or an explicit "no findings" conclusion with brief evidence. Passing tests, lint, type checks, and acceptance criteria cannot substitute for this pass. If the diff has little or no runtime surface, say so while still reviewing the changed tests, examples, documentation, and build behavior.

**Completion criterion:** all five lenses have an evidence-based conclusion, and every actionable finding is classified as blocking, non-blocking, or follow-up.

### 3. Run tests independently

Run the targeted tests from the plan, then the appropriate broader suite, linter, type checker, or build. Distinguish:

- tests Claude reported,
- tests Codex actually ran,
- pre-existing failures,
- new failures caused by the implementation,
- live/manual checks still outstanding.

**Completion criterion:** Codex has fresh local output for every required automated check and has reviewed every changed file.

### 4. Decide

- **Pass:** proceed to Final Report only when both Pass A and Pass B are clean and the independent test gate passes.
- **Fixable findings:** write a review file and enter the Revision Loop.
- **Ambiguous requirements, destructive conflict, or external blocker:** stop and ask the user.

## Revision Loop

Write concise findings to a temporary Markdown or JSON file. Every blocking finding must contain:

- severity,
- file and location,
- observed behavior,
- expected behavior,
- evidence such as a failing command or diff excerpt,
- required correction without prescribing unnecessary refactors.

Resume the same Claude session:

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/claude_worker.py revise \
  --workdir "$PWD" \
  --session-id <session-id> \
  --review /absolute/path/to/codex-review.md \
  --model opus
```

After each revision, repeat the entire Codex review and independent test gate. Do not review only the files Claude says it changed.

Maximum: two revision passes. After the second failed gate, report the unresolved findings to the user with concrete evidence and ask how to proceed.

**Completion criterion:** either Codex passes the complete final state or the user receives a bounded escalation instead of an endless agent loop.

## Final Report

Only Codex reports completion. Include:

- What was implemented
- Files changed
- Claude implementation/test summary
- Contract-review verdict
- Separate engineering-review findings for quality, security, simplicity, maintainability, and test quality
- Tests Codex independently ran and their actual outcomes
- Any manual/live checks still outstanding
- Remaining risks or follow-ups

Do not call a change "approval-ready" when only the contract and automated checks passed. If the engineering review was not completed, say so plainly and withhold approval.

Do not imply commit, push, PR creation, deployment, or publication unless those actions were explicitly requested and verified.

## Worker Output Contract

The worker prints one JSON object. Important fields:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "mode": "implement",
  "model": "opus",
  "session_id": "...",
  "worker_result": {
    "status": "completed",
    "summary": "...",
    "files_changed": [],
    "tests": [],
    "plan_deviations": [],
    "blockers": [],
    "notes": []
  }
}
```

A shell exit code of zero means Claude ran and produced schema-valid output. It does not mean Codex approved the implementation.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Inverting ownership.** Claude implements; Codex plans and gates. Never ask Claude to approve itself.
2. **Starting a fresh revision session.** Use `--resume`; otherwise Claude loses implementation context.
3. **Trusting reported tests.** Codex reruns them independently.
4. **Passing chat history instead of a contract.** Give Claude a self-contained plan with acceptance criteria.
5. **Using `--bare`.** It disables subscription OAuth and can force API-key authentication.
6. **Allowing Git publication.** The worker prohibits commit/push, but Codex must still inspect history and status if behavior looks suspicious.
7. **Infinite ping-pong.** Two revision passes, then user escalation.
8. **Parallel edits in one tree.** Wait for Claude to exit before Codex edits or launches another worker.
9. **Mistaking structured output for proof.** Git state and fresh command output are proof.
10. **Loading user-level Claude plugins.** Personal hooks can consume turns or write helper artifacts into the repository. The wrapper intentionally disables user plugins, uses only project/local settings, redirects runtime caches outside the repository, and disables slash-command skills; do not remove that isolation without testing it.
11. **Treating overload as an implementation failure.** Claude may return HTTP 429/529 before doing work. The wrapper retries the same Opus request once by default; if both attempts fail, preserve repository state and report the provider outage. Never downgrade models without explicit user confirmation.
12. **Equating acceptance with approval.** A diff can meet every requirement and still be insecure, brittle, confusing, or over-engineered. Run and report the separate engineering-review pass before approval.
13. **Equating `--model opus` with literal purity.** The flag selects the primary model but does not rule out internal helper models. Load `coding-agent-model-purity`, inspect raw metadata, and fail closed when purity is an acceptance criterion.
14. **Treating plan approval as a usage override.** Approval to implement does not authorize spending above the 85% usage gate. Surface the current windows and ask explicitly before adding `--allow-high-usage` to that one invocation.
